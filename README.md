# rl-2023-final-project
Final Project for Reinforcement Learning 2023/2024 at Sapienza University. Our
goal is to reproduce the paper [Evolutionary Population Curriculum for Scaling
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10423), but
change it to apply to discrete instead of continuous spaces. The authors have
provided an [implementation](https://github.com/qian18long/epciclr2020) of the
method that we can use for inspiration.

# Environment
We will use the [PressurePlate](https://github.com/uoe-agents/pressureplate)
environment. We can directly install this environment from its github repo:

```
pip install git+git@github.com:uoe-agents/pressureplate.git
```
